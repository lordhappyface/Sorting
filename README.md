# Sorting

## Helper Methods

First, you need to implement the code in the `SortProfiler` class to reverse an `int[]` in-place.
The method stub is provided, and it is called `reverse`.

You should add a few tests in the `runTests` method to make sure your reversing method works
correctly.

## Selection Sort

You should implement a selection sort in the method `selectionSort` in the `SortProfiler` class.
It should sort the provided array in-place (meaning that the array passed in as a parameter 
becomes sorted; a new array is not created).

You should add a few tests in the `runTests` method to make sure your selection sort method
works correctly.

You should uncomment the Selection Sort portion of the `main` method. You should also
run the `main` method a few times and record the results in a google document/spreadsheet.

## Insertion Sort

You should implement an insertion sort in the method `insertionSort` in the `SortProfiler` class.
It should sort the provided array in-place (meaning that the array passed in as a parameter 
becomes sorted; a new array is not created).

You should add a few tests in the `runTests` method to make sure your insertion sort method
works correctly.

You should uncomment the Insertion Sort portion of the `main` method. You should also
run the `main` method a few times and record the results in a google document/spreadsheet.

## Merge Sort

You should implement a merge sort in the method `mergeSort` in the `SortProfiler` class.
It should sort the provided array in-place (meaning that the array passed in as a parameter 
becomes sorted). You will need to create new arrays as part of the splitting action, but the
final results should be in the array passed as a parameter.

You will also need to implement the `merge` method as part of the merge sort.

You should add a few tests in the `runTests` method to make sure your merge sort method
works correctly.

You should uncomment the Merge Sort portion of the `main` method. You should also
run the `main` method a few times and record the results in a google document/spreadsheet.
